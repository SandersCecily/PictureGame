# PictureGame

## Introduction
This application is a game that randomly shuffles the images using the Yates-Fisher random shuffle to have the user click each image once consecutively. If they reclick an image the game resets to 0 and they have a chance to start again. Theres one function that controls the gameplay. 

## Technologies
 * React
 * HTML 
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * json

## Challenges
Challenges I faced when making this application was the onclick in the index.js of the container and binding it to the card. Another challenge was making sure that the react module was properly presented in github. Upon first push/deployment the website only read the readme so I found an article to help explain how to properly show the code. That article is: 
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089. 
To find the information on github pages you just need to scroll down the page. A smaller challenge that I faced was that I can't see the highscore that was achieved in the nav bar. I created a footer but until I like the UI I decided not to include it.

## Improvements
I would love to do more UI improvements and adding some extra bells and whistles to the game itself. This would not only include animations but different fonts and overall a better look with more images and maybe shadows to give dimension to the website so it seems over all less flat. I feel a better color scheme would be nice too. Another feature that would be nice to add is rotating pictures out. So you could have a database of say 100 pictures and only display 12 and let the player keep going. Or better skim a google result page and use images filtered by noncomercial reuse. And if you did do the skim you could also have the user input what theme of game they would like to play.
